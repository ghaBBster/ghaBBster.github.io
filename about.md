## Notable Projects

### Enterprise Vulnerability Management System
**Challenge**: Manual vulnerability assessments were time-consuming and inconsistent across the organization.

**Solution**: Developed automated Python scanning framework with standardized reporting and risk prioritization.

**Result**: Achieved 60% reduction in assessment time while improving accuracy and providing consistent, actionable reports.

### Security Incident Response Optimization
**Challenge**: High volume of security events (20,000/month) was causing alert fatigue and delayed responses.

**Solution**: Implemented Splunk-based automated filtering, correlation rules, and prioritization workflows.

**Result**: Reduced incident response time by 50% and significantly decreased false positive alerts.

### Security Awareness Training Program
**Challenge**: Employees lacked cybersecurity awareness, leading to preventable security incidents.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive training curriculum with practical exercises and regular assessment.

**Result**: Measurable reduction in malware incidents and improved organizational security culture.
